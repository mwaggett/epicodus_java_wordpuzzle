# Word Puzzle

##### _Java BDD Code Review for Epicodus, 14 August 2015_

#### By Molly Waggett

## Description

This app allows the user to input a word or phrase, resulting in the same
  word or phrase except with dashes ("-") replacing every vowel. The user may
  then give the resulting puzzle to a friend who must try to guess the original
  word or phrase.

_The guesser should not be able to see the original input, but I realize that
  the input is visible as a parameter in the url. I know there is a way to
  prevent this, but just haven't learned it yet._
